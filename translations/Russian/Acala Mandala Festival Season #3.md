The BTC gateway is provided by RenVM, while the minting and burning renBTC on Acala is provided by the gateway module.

**_Two upfront benefits that Ren users can instantly enjoy:_**

1.  A brand new account only holding freshly minted renBTC can perform any transaction on Acala without needing a fee token. Thanks to Acala‚Äôs FlexiFee feature, tokens like renBTC are integrated natively as one of the default fee tokens alongside with ACA, aUSD and DOT.
2.  Fees for minting renBTC can be waived without compromising security. We see this as essential to boost the usage of renBTC on Acala and within the wider Polkadot ecosystem.

Ren is a great example for DeFi projects entering the Polkadot multi-chain universe. Because Acala is a customizable and fully optimized finance platform, the upfront economic and technical costs involved in building a separate blockchain (aka parachain) are instantly removed.

## Mandala Fest #3: Something for Everyone

As we continue to collaborate with projects across chains and reaching new audiences, we know that **building Acala is a community effort**. Mandala Fest then becomes a celebration of this growing community and the wealth of possibility that awaits us all in building web3. We also believe that **web3 should be for everyone and we want Acala to be open to all builders: from crypto enthusiasts to node runners, developers, bloggers, economists, marketers, deep thinkers and the curious.**

To celebrate this inclusivity and mark the third season, we‚Äôre going BIG. Acala is hosting the festival in collaboration with [Laminar](http://laminar.one/) (synthetic asset and margin trading), [Ren](https://renproject.io/) (permissionless inter-blockchain value transfer), [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) (leading mobile wallet for Polkadot) and Polkaworld (leading Polkadot community).

The event will consist of a trading competition, a [Black Thursday](https://decrypt.co/26299/black-thursday-reshaped-bitcoin-futures-market-report) Simulation as well as our standard blog and bug bounties scheduled to keep you busy throughout season 3!

**Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôve mapped it out with all the details of reward pools and duration:**

## Week 2 Trading Competition

**Duration**: 03-August-2020 to 10-August-2020 (one week)

**The rules for ranking of trading competition :**

- Snapshots will be taken for both Acala and Laminar networks at the beginning of the trading competition; the total net value of various assets (including debts) will be calculated based on the price feed at the time as the initial balance.
- Another snapshot will be taken at the end of the competition, using the feed price at that time as the final balance. Cross-chain transfers (e.g. transfers between Acala and Laminar) are not counted, while transfers between addresses are counted as capital.
- Profit margin = total value of final balance / (total value of initial balance + capital sum correction) ‚Äî 100%, all accounts are ranked according to this function

**The following are included in the balance calculation:**

**Balances of all assets:**  
‚Äî Acala : aUSD, ACA, renBTC, XBTC, DOT, LDOT  
‚Äî Laminar : aUSD, LAMI, synthetic assets

**Balances of all DeFi positions:**  
‚Äî Acala : CDP (net value of collateral value minus debt value), share value in Deposit & Earn
