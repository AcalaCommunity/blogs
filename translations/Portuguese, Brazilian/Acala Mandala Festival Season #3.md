We can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already time for our third season of Mandala Festival, it seems like only yesterday we were announcing the inaugural edition back in March! We‚Äôve been blown away by your support, enthusiasm and the wealth of activity we‚Äôve had on the network ever since.

The first two seasons attracted a lot of attention, with a considerable influx of participants and a flurry of meaningful activity:

üìà 1300+ node runners  
üë• 600 + app users  
‚úçÔ∏è 30+ bloggers  
üêû 30+ bug hunters  
‚úÖ 4000+ new accounts  
‚õìÔ∏è 40,000 + meaningful transactions

## Mandala TC4 Cross-Chain DeFi

As **we launch this third season of the festival on Monday 27th of July**, it‚Äôs perhaps time to reiterate **Acala‚Äôs main mission: enable an interconnected, autonomous, efficient and sophisticated cross-blockchain finance ecosystem.** Because Acala is a finance hub on Polkadot, it provides a suite of financial primitives including multi-collateralized stablecoin, trustless staking derivative and a decentralized exchange. These primitives are offered via the Acala dApp, directly to end-users, and also as SDKs for other dApps to build on.

## The most recent updates in making cross chain DeFi a reality are as follows:

- **_Acala‚Äôs full-fledged DeFi suite_** _is now open_: multi-collateralized stablecoin supporting DOT, LDOT, renBTC as collaterals, staking derivative and decentralized exchange
- **_Laminar trading_**: aUSD can now be transferred to the Laminar Chain to create synthetic assets like synthetic fiat (e.g. EUR, USD), and for margin trading a variety of instruments e.g. forex, gold, stocks and synthetic crypto pairs
- [**_Ren x Acala collaboration is live_**](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/bringing-btc-to-polkadot-acala-x-ren-e7959855d5aa): Reputable inter-blockchain asset bridge Ren [built with Acala](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki/U.-Build-with-Acala) by deploying its [RenVM bridge module](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/tree/master/ecosystem-modules/ren/renvm-bridge) on the Acala Network. The BTC gateway is provided by RenVM, while the minting and burning renBTC on Acala is provided by the gateway module.

**_Two upfront benefits that Ren users can instantly enjoy:_**

1.  A brand new account only holding freshly minted renBTC can perform any transaction on Acala without needing a fee token. Thanks to Acala‚Äôs FlexiFee feature, tokens like renBTC are integrated natively as one of the default fee tokens alongside with ACA, aUSD and DOT.
2.  Fees for minting renBTC can be waived without compromising security. We see this as essential to boost the usage of renBTC on Acala and within the wider Polkadot ecosystem.

Ren is a great example for DeFi projects entering the Polkadot multi-chain universe. Because Acala is a customizable and fully optimized finance platform, the upfront economic and technical costs involved in building a separate blockchain (aka parachain) are instantly removed.

## Mandala Fest #3: Something for Everyone

As we continue to collaborate with projects across chains and reaching new audiences, we know that **building Acala is a community effort**. Mandala Fest then becomes a celebration of this growing community and the wealth of possibility that awaits us all in building web3. We also believe that **web3 should be for everyone and we want Acala to be open to all builders: from crypto enthusiasts to node runners, developers, bloggers, economists, marketers, deep thinkers and the curious.**

To celebrate this inclusivity and mark the third season, we‚Äôre going BIG. Acala is hosting the festival in collaboration with [Laminar](http://laminar.one/) (synthetic asset and margin trading), [Ren](https://renproject.io/) (permissionless inter-blockchain value transfer), [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) (leading mobile wallet for Polkadot) and Polkaworld (leading Polkadot community).

The event will consist of a trading competition, a [Black Thursday](https://decrypt.co/26299/black-thursday-reshaped-bitcoin-futures-market-report) Simulation as well as our standard blog and bug bounties scheduled to keep you busy throughout season 3!

**Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôve mapped it out with all the details of reward pools and duration:**

- Another snapshot will be taken at the end of the competition, using the feed price at that time as the final balance. Cross-chain transfers (e.g. transfers between Acala and Laminar) are not counted, while transfers between addresses are counted as capital.
- Profit margin = total value of final balance / (total value of initial balance + capital sum correction) ‚Äî 100%, all accounts are ranked according to this function

**The following are included in the balance calculation:**

**Balances of all assets:**  
‚Äî Acala : aUSD, ACA, renBTC, XBTC, DOT, LDOT
