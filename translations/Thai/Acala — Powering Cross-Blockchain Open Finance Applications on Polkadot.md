เรารู้สึกตื่นเต้นที่จะประกาศ [Acala](https://acala.network/) — **_กลุ่มการเงินแบบกระจายศูนย์แห่งแรกของ Polkadot Chain _** ที่มีวิสัยทัศน์ในการสร้างโครงสร้างพื้นฐานทางการเงินแบบเปิดข้ามเครือข่ายสำหรับระบบนิเวศ Polkadot Acala มุ่งหวังที่จะนำความมั่นคงและสภาพคล่องมาสู่โลกของ crypto การใช้งานเริ่มต้นคือ **_Cross-chain ที่มีความสามารถ multi-collateralized และ decentralized stablecoin_** โดยอิงจาก Substrate ซึ่ง **_สามารถโอนไปยังเครือข่ายทั้งหมดบนเครือข่าย Polkadot_**

Acala is founded by two active members in the Polkadot ecosystem: [Laminar](https://laminar.one/) and [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/). We are running the Acala network in the form of a consortium, because:

- we believe that as a **_common-good foundational layer_** of the Polkadot DeFi ecosystem, the protocols should **_NOT_** be dominated by any single entity;
- we are building **_a community-owned stablecoin network_**, where stakeholders, participants, and users are able to govern the core monetary policies of the ecosystem collectively;
- we are **_broadening the membership and inviting ecosystem participants_** to join the consortium and the movement towards a truly decentralized and community-owned currency.

## Web3 Foundation Grant

This announcement coincides with great news from the Web3 Foundation that **_a significant development grant_** has been awarded to the Acala stablecoin project, which is a recognition of the team’s effort and our solution as part of the DeFi ecosystem. We are excited to be part of the W3F and Polkadot family and look forward to closer collaboration and further contribution towards the ecosystem.

> “We’re excited to see a community-led project build a stable coin for Polkadot. It could be a key part of infrastructure that will enable various use cases in the Polkadot network such as DeFi and gaming applications.” — Jack Platts, Head of Collaborations at Web3 Foundation

## Substrate Builder Program Inaugural Member

Acala is also proud to be selected to join the first batch of the [Substrate Builder Program](http://builders.parity.io/). The Substrate Builders Program powered by Parity identifies, supports and mentors current and potential Substrate-based blockchain projects that are building impactful chains. We look forward to working closely with the Parity team and other builders to take the development of Acala’s protocols, products, and community to the next level.

# Connecting the Dots (aka Value Networks)

The significance of cross-chain communication to the blockchain is like that of the internet to the intranet. Polkadot empowers a network of blockchains to interact with **_true interoperability, economic and transactional scalability_**. Currently, valuable networks namely Bitcoin, Ethereum and other public, enterprise consortium networks are operating mostly in silos. As such, they are far from realizing their full potential. Polkadot’s shared security model and cross-blockchain communication — covering the exchange of information and value — will inevitably give rises to **_fairer peer-to-peer digital jurisdictions and autonomous economies_**. This creates the basis for truly open finance — that leans more **towards public good than siloed private infrastructure** — that many have envisioned but never had the means to realize.

When we look at an organization, **_it is the people in it that manifest the culture and values_**. When we look at a blockchain network, which intrinsically is a social construct, it is the community and participants who make the network come to life. **_Polkadot is a community of builders_**. Just to name a few this community includes: [Parity](https://www.parity.io/), a long-term builder in the Ethereum community and now Polkadot’s lead development team; [ChainX](https://chainx.org/), the asset gateway bridging and integrating assets from other blockchains such as BTC, ETH, EOS, etc to the Polkadot ecosystem; [Plasm network](https://medium.com/stake-technologies/plasm-testnet-launch-90d7e58328b3), a platform to build scalable decentralized applications; [Laminar](https://www.laminar.one/), a synthetic asset, and margin trading platform to bridge on-and-off chain liquidity; [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/), one of the first mobile wallets in the Polkadot ecosystem; [Polymath](https://blog.polymath.network/polymesh-leveraging-the-substrate-framework-ede8a77c6019), a compliant security token platform will build out a new base layer blockchain on Substrate, and [Chainlink](https://medium.com/web3foundation/web3-foundation-and-chainlink-announce-collaboration-df55ed462a3a), an open-source oracle system will also contribute to Polkadot, making much of off-chain data feeds, and various APIs available to all chains on the Polkadot network.

# Acala Protocols

The first two protocols in Acala’s portfolio that are now under construction would serve as the stepping stones towards stability and liquidity as the foundation for a freer and more open finance future for the masses.

## Honzon — The Stablecoin Protocol

The first is a decentralized cross-chain capable multi-collateralized stablecoin powered by the Honzon Protocol, a cross-chain stablecoin system that will:

- create a sound, stable currency for low cost, borderless value transfer for all chains in the network
- enable business lending with predictable risk
- serve as a building block for more open finance services

The ACALA stablecoin, a.k.a. aUSD, is pegged to USD at 1:1 ratio. Essentially users would take out a loan of aUSD by locking selected valuable crypto assets e.g. DOT, BTC or ETH as collateral. Users would need to pay interests to maintain this loan. The Honzon protocols have a set of mechanisms to maintain stability and manage risks from price fluctuation of the underlying collateral asset.

## Homa — The Tokenized Staking Liquidity Protocol

The second protocol Homa for tokenized staking liquidity — to alleviate the challenge of opportunity cost of using staking assets other than staking, and risking network security if returns are higher in other applications such as DeFi. The Homa Protocol establishes a staking pool tokenizing users’ staked assets (e.g. L-DOT as locked DOT) that will

- provide liquidity for staked assets (which would otherwise be locked without further use)
- enable future markets of the staked assets
- be tradable and liquid cross all chains on the Polkadot network.

This article will focus more on the stablecoin product, and more information will be released later as we progress.

# Acala Stablecoin

Existing stablecoins and crypto-assets are limited by their underlying blockchains in general, while isolation of the ledgers leads to isolation of the corresponding assets, limiting their usage and adoption. A common challenge for the existing stablecoin systems is that crypto-assets that can be used as collaterals are restrained to the type of assets available on the particular blockchain that the stablecoin system is launched on, which caps the total debt ceiling and stablecoin supply. In addition, it is counter-intuitive for non-crypto mainstream users to transfer one currency while paying blockchain gas fees in another.

Acala Stablecoin Network is built on Substrate and to be connected to the Polkadot network, that it will be interoperable with all networks in the ecosystem and beyond.

- **Multi-collateral backed**: collaterals can be both native Polkadot assets like DOT and beyond, such as popular crypto-assets like BTC and ETH, which can be bridged into the Polkadot network and used as collaterals to achieve higher supply ceiling.
- **Cross-chain capability**: stablecoin powered by Acala Network can be transferred to all chains in the network.
- **Secured**: Acala Network will be secured by the Polkadot’s shared security model.
- **Community-owned**: Acala network participants will gradually govern and share earnings of the network collectively, achieving true decentralization and censorship resistance ultimately.
- **Specialized Stablecoin Chain**: Acala Network will be able to customize its fee schedule, for instance, free transfer of the balance that would enhance usability hugely while maintaining network security.
- **Future Proof**: Acala Network is built on Substrate, that it is truly resilient, and able to adapt and upgrade itself without forking.
