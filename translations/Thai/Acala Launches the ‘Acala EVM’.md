## The Acala EVM leverages the best of Ethereum while unlocking Substrate‚Äôs full potential with a composable, single-wallet, Acala-EVM-Substrate-WASM experience with ‚Äòbring your own gas‚Äô, on-chain auto-scheduling, and more.

Acala‚Äôs engineering team has custom-built and launched the Acala EVM! This innovation, novel to the Polkadot ecosystem, enables Acala to provide Solidity, Substrate, and Web3 developers a complete full-stack (Acala+EVM+Substrate+WASM) experience seamlessly with a single wallet. Acala EVM also brings protocol composability for EVM and Substrate runtime (aka pallets) and enables developers to build and deploy DApps on Acala with exceptional tooling support.

Just like Ethereum can do things Bitcoin will never be able to do, which subsequently inspired many new innovations, Substrate and Polkadot are categorically different from Ethereum in a way that will empower many new, chain-level innovations outside of the EVM sandbox. We are firm believers in the power of Substrate and built the Acala EVM to optimize for Substrate‚Äôs full potential and longevity, rather than simply redeploying Ethereum on Polkadot.

# **The Acala EVM**

## **Composable DeFi Environment**

Smart Contract Dapps deployed in Acala EVM can directly use native and cross-chain assets such as DOT, ACA, aUSD, renBTC, XBTC, and more. ERC-20 tokens deployed in the EVM can also be made available at the runtime level, to be listed in the DEX, or (by governance approval) to be used as gas fee tokens. This means that, for example, our friends at Ampleforth can deploy AMPL contracts on Acala EVM to be made available as a native token, so it can be used to pay transaction fees and listed directly on our DEX.

New to the concept of composability? A16z put it very well in their [4 Eras of Blockchain Computing: Degrees of Composability](https://a16z.com/2018/12/16/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability/#:~:text=A%20platform%20is%20composable%20if,more%20rapid%20and%20compounding%20innovation.).

To make this a bit more ‚Äòreal‚Äô, watch below as Acala Co-Founder and CTO Bryan Chen recently demonstrates one use case of the Acala EVM when he deployed Uniswap onto Acala and executed a trade within 2 minutes:

## **Other Fully Composable DeFi Primitives in the Acala EVM**

- **Bring your own gas**: Power transactions with virtually any token ‚Äî The native and cross-chain tokens integrated with Acala will be able to be used for paying gas. When live it could look like this: _Are you sending wrapped ETH to Acala to start playing in DeFi? Send your ETH to Acala via the bridge, and start deploying your wrapped ETH immediately in the Acala DeFi apps using your wrapped ETH as the gas fee. No need to go out and find ACA._
- **On-chain automatic scheduler** that enables use cases like subscriptions and recurring payments. Try it [here](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/smart-contracts/advanced/use-on-chain-scheduler) or watch the 6 min demo below.

- **Native and cross-chain tokens** available in ERC20: DOT, ACA, aUSD, XBTC (from ChainX), LDOT (liquid staking DOT), RENBTC, and more
- Network of oracles to get price feeds. Try it [here](https://wiki.acala.network/build/development-guide/smart-contracts/advanced/use-oracle-feeds).
- Protocols such as DEX, stablecoin lending, and liquid staking derivatives (e.g. liquid DOT for your staked DOT)

# **Acala at a High Level**

If you‚Äôre new here, Acala is an Ethereum-compatible decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built for scale, leveraging Polkadot‚Äôs multi-chain network. Although Acala is a parachain providing layer 1 infrastructure, the Acala team has also built out an entire application layer on top of the parachain. Acala‚Äôs applications are built around a stable asset (aUSD) and offers end-user applications such as borrowing, lending, synthetic asset trading, and interest earning, all executed extremely fast with inexpensive gas fees. Developers can also leverage Acala as a platform on which to build their own applications.

The platform offers a suite of financial primitives: a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets like Bitcoin, a trustless staking derivative, and a decentralized exchange. **Overall, Acala‚Äôs platform also offers:**

1.  **Micro Gas Fees** ‚Äî Acala solves the gas fee problem for DeFi users, in combination with the ability to ‚Äòbring your own gas‚Äô as mentioned above
2.  **Staking derivative L-DOT** (Liquid DOT to release liquidity from staked DOT for use in Acala‚Äôs DeFi applications)
3.  **Stablecoin borrowing and lending** (DOT, Bitcoin and L-DOT used as primary collateral asset)
4.  **Earning yield and interest**
5.  Trading on **decentralized exchange** (DEX)
6.  On-chain **governance**
7.  On-chain **Treasury**
8.  Native network of **aggregated oracle price feeds**
9.  **On-chain sovereign wealth fund** to sustain the network‚Äôs future ([read more](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/building-a-decentralized-sovereign-wealth-fund-6a5a0ae995b1))
10. **Continuously upgrade with no forks**: Keep in mind that Acala can upgrade seamlessly with no forks. This means that the future is virtually limitless. Any new Substrate pallet (a product or feature in the form of a DeFi primitive or runtime) can smoothly integrate into Acala. It‚Äôs like getting an iPhone 12 that will auto-upgrade to a 13, 14, 15+ in the palm of your hand.
