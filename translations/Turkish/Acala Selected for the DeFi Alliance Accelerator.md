Acala is honored and thrilled to be one of twelve teams selected for [the second cohort of the DeFi Alliance accelerator program](https://medium.com/@lmrankhan/defi-alliance-announces-cohort-2-liquidity-launchpad-5bbaf76cde32), out of more than 100 applications. We are joined by the following teams innovating in the decentralized finance space: [_Pods_](http://pods.finance/)_,_ [_Paraswap_](https://paraswap.io/#/)_, Saddle,_ [_Notional_](http://notional.finance/)_,_ [_Tokenlon_](http://tokenlon.im/)_,_ [_Vega_](http://vega.xyz/)_,_ [_Derivadex_](https://derivadex.com/)_,_ [_Perpetual,_](http://perp.fi/) [_Loopring_](https://loopring.org/#/)_,_ [_Deversifi_](http://deversifi.com/)_, and_ [_Mcdex_](https://mcdex.io/)_._

The [DeFi Alliance](https://defialliance.co)â€™s inaugural cohort hosted some of the top DeFi teams including 0x, dYdX, Kyber Network, IDEX, Opyn, Set Protocol, and Synthetix. The program helps connect the cohort participants with a network of experts and resources, with a particular focus on designing liquidity mining programs and onboarding liquidity providers to bootstrap liquidity.

We look forward to learning from the mentors and Alliance members including firms such as Jump Trading, DRW/Cumberland, CMT Digital, Volt Capital, Alameda Research, ParaFi, Spartan Group, Framework Ventures, Gauntlet, Aave, Compound, Kyber Network, Synthetix, Mechanism, and many other trading firms, venture investors, legal experts, and alumni of the accelerator program.

The DeFi Alliance also launched a potential game-changer **Liquidity Launchpad program,** partnering with [Teller Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teller-finance-announces-october-launch-130000981.html) to source institutional liquidity for DeFi protocols and lower barriers for wider consumers to access DeFi products. Acala is excited to partake and contribute to growing the ecosystem together, and thanks to the DeFi Alliance team for such an opportunity.
