# Our Values

As a close knit team of engineers working remotely from Auckland (New Zealand), Tirana (Albania), Shanghai (China), and Los Angeles (USA), we are building Acala based on a core set of values we believe are in line with the tenets of web3:

- True decentralization
- Less Trust, More Truth
- Empowering individuals with more autonomy
- Integrity
- Accountability

Our team came together because of a deep desire to build the foundations for a new, inclusive financial system, in direct contrast to the clear shortcomings and challenges of the current system and institutions across geographies. Our team includes some of the leading blockchain innovators, Substrate and Rust developers, full-stack dApp developers and economists.

- **Inclusion, Care, Trust, & Respect**
- **Guidance and Support**
- **Friendship, Community, Real Relationships**
- **Empowerment**

Being part of building Web 3.0 means impacting true, meaningful change on the world. It puts people in the driving seat, after decades of passive participation. We want our community to know their work can make a difference in moving society and the human race forward, so we decided to launch our very own **Acala Ambassador Program**.
