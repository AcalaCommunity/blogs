[Acala](http://acala.network) and [Injective](http://injectiveprotocol.com), both [Pantera Capital](https://www.panteracapital.com/portfolio) portfolio projects and [DeFi Alliance](https://defialliance.co/) members, will work together to integrate the Acala Dollar (aUSD) into Injective’s derivative trading ecosystem. The integration of aUSD will provide a stable asset that can be used to collateralize Polkadot-based derivative products on Injective. This also expands opportunities for us to create new derivative products alongside Injective, further increasing the use cases for aUSD.

Injective is a layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol that unlocks the full potential of derivatives and DeFi. Injective’s platform enables fully decentralized trading without any restrictions, allowing individuals to trade on any derivative market. The Injective Chain currently provides a two-way Ethereum peg-zone for Ether and ERC-20 tokens to be transferred to the Injective Chain as well as an EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications. The core consensus is Tendermint-based, but Injective’s multi-chain strategy is taking them to the Polkadot ecosystem as they plan to build on top of a parachain.
