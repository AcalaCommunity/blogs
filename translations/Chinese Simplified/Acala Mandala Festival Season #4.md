# Mandala TC5 Optimised for DeFi

As we launch this fourth season of the festival on Halloween night Saturday 31st of October, it‚Äôs perhaps time to reiterate Acala‚Äôs mission, **as the decentralized financial (DeFi) hub of Polkadot**: to make it fast and easy to use or build financial applications, improving trading efficiency and saving valuable time. We have recently launched [Karura](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/introducing-karura-acalas-defi-parachain-on-kusama-af2f2695b07a) network to extend our mission to serve the Kusama community as its primary DeFi hub. We have launched a new testnet candidate (TC5) alongside this festival with the following updates doubling down on our effort to accelerate DeFi innovations.

We have launched a new testnet candidate (TC5) alongside this festival with the following updates doubling down on our effort to accelerate DeFi innovations.

## The most recent updates in optimizing for DeFi a reality are as follows:

- **Oracle Gateway:** this is an open, more decentralized, and DeFi optimized oracle infrastructure available to all DApps built on Acala. It allows multiple oracle service providers to provide price feeds, and DApps will enjoy Quality of Service regardless of how congested the network is and whichever provider they choose. See [orml-oracle](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/oracle).

See [orml-oracle](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/oracle).
- **Generic NFT support:** we deployed [orml-nft](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/nft) to enable any NFT publishers to build and leverage Acala‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem (Kusama also adopted this module to support NFT natively). We‚Äôve eaten our own dog food and deployed Acala‚Äôs [publisher NFT module](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/blob/master/modules/nft/src/lib.rs) to **_issue collectibles for Mandala Festival participants_**.

- **Tokenized DeX LP share:** Acala Swap is an automatic market maker type decentralized exchange. We have tokenized LP shares to support liquidity bootstrap. We have tokenized LP shares to support liquidity bootstrap.
- **LDOT sub-staking accounts:** via Acala‚Äôs trustless staking facility, you can nominate more than the default 16 validators, and enjoy optimized returns and liquidity, while also have differentiated delegated voting rights on Polkadot. LDOT will be one of the base financial instruments powering new economic innovations based on PoS. LDOT will be one of the base financial instruments powering new economic innovations based on PoS.
