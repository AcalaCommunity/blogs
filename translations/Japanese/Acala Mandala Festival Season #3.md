## Mandala TC4 クロスチェーンDeFi

7月27日（月）にフェスティバルの第3シーズンを開始するにあたり、**Acalaの主なミッションである「相互接続された、自律的で、効率的かつ洗練されたクロスブロックチェーンの金融エコシステムを実現する」に関して改めて説明します。** AcalaはPolkadot上の金融ハブであるため、マルチ担保のステーブルコイン、信頼性の高いステーキングデリバティブ、分散型取引所など、一連の金融プリミティブを提供します。 各プリミティブは、Acala dAppを介してエンドユーザーに直接提供されるほか、他のdAppが構築するためのSDKとしても提供されます。

## クロスチェーンDeFiを実現するための最新のアップデートは以下の通りです：

- **_Acalaの本格的なDeFiスイート_** _ニューリリース_：DOT、LDOT、renBTCを担保としてサポートするマルチ担保のステーブルコイン、ステーキングデリバティブ、分散型取引所
- **_Laminar trading_**：aUSDをLaminar Chainに転送して、合成フィアット（EUR、USDなど）のような合成資産を作成したり、FX、金、株式、合成暗号ペアなどの様々な商品の証拠金取引を行うことができるようになりました。
- [**_Ren x Acalaのコラボレーションはライブです_**](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/bringing-btc-to-polkadot-acala-x-ren-e7959855d5aa)。Reputable inter-blockchain asset bridge Ren [RenVM bridge module](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki/U.-Build-with-Acala)をAcala Networkに展開することで、Acala</a>との間で構築されます。 BTCゲートウェイはRenVMが提供しており、AcalaでのrenBTCのミントとバーンはゲートウェイモジュールが提供しています。

**_Renユーザーがすぐに享受できる2つの先行したメリット：_**

1.  新規にミントされたrenBTCを保有するだけの新しいアカウントは、手数料トークンを必要とせずにAcalaであらゆる取引を行うことができます。 AcalaのFlexiFee機能のおかげで、renBTCなどのトークンは、ACA、aUSD、DOTと並んで、デフォルトのフィー・トークンの一つとしてネイティブに統合されています。
2.  RenBTCをミントする為の手数料はセキュリティを損なうことなく無料にすることができます。 We see this as essential to boost the usage of renBTC on Acala and within the wider Polkadot ecosystem.

Ren is a great example for DeFi projects entering the Polkadot multi-chain universe. Because Acala is a customizable and fully optimized finance platform, the upfront economic and technical costs involved in building a separate blockchain (aka parachain) are instantly removed.

## Mandala Fest #3: Something for Everyone

As we continue to collaborate with projects across chains and reaching new audiences, we know that **building Acala is a community effort**. Mandala Fest then becomes a celebration of this growing community and the wealth of possibility that awaits us all in building web3. We also believe that **web3 should be for everyone and we want Acala to be open to all builders: from crypto enthusiasts to node runners, developers, bloggers, economists, marketers, deep thinkers and the curious.**

To celebrate this inclusivity and mark the third season, we’re going BIG. Acala is hosting the festival in collaboration with [Laminar](http://laminar.one/) (synthetic asset and margin trading), [Ren](https://renproject.io/) (permissionless inter-blockchain value transfer), [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) (leading mobile wallet for Polkadot) and Polkaworld (leading Polkadot community).

The event will consist of a trading competition, a [Black Thursday](https://decrypt.co/26299/black-thursday-reshaped-bitcoin-futures-market-report) Simulation as well as our standard blog and bug bounties scheduled to keep you busy throughout season 3!

**Here’s how we’ve mapped it out with all the details of reward pools and duration:**

**Participation Rules:**

**The rules for ranking of trading competition :**

- Snapshots will be taken for both Acala and Laminar networks at the beginning of the trading competition; the total net value of various assets (including debts) will be calculated based on the price feed at the time as the initial balance.
- Another snapshot will be taken at the end of the competition, using the feed price at that time as the final balance. Cross-chain transfers (e.g. transfers between Acala and Laminar) are not counted, while transfers between addresses are counted as capital.
- Profit margin = total value of final balance / (total value of initial balance + capital sum correction) — 100%, all accounts are ranked according to this function

**The following are included in the balance calculation:**

**Balances of all assets:**  
— Acala : aUSD, ACA, renBTC, XBTC, DOT, LDOT  
— Laminar : aUSD, LAMI, synthetic assets

**Balances of all DeFi positions:**  
— Acala : CDP (net value of collateral value minus debt value), share value in Deposit & Earn
