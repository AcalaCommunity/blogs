# 更新

## ロードマップ & ウェブサイト更新

私たちは、ParityやPolkadotのエンジニアと緊密に連携して、パラチェーンの準備とPolkadotのメインネットローンチに合わせて、ロードマップを常時更新しており、その中のいくつかをご紹介致します。

- Kusamaパラチェーンの準備が整い次第、Acara・Karuraのカナリアネットワークをローンチします。
- Acalaのセキュリティ監査を開始します。
- Acalaメインネット (プレーンネットワーク) をローンチし、Polkadotの準備ができ次第、パラチェーンオークションに参加します。
- 次の段階として、ネットワークの安定稼働が確認でき次第、ステーブルコインを有効化します。

## Responding to Recent DeFi Black Swan Event

Recent DeFi Black Swan event specifically re [MakerDAO multi-million dollar incident](https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6) has brought several network and market structural issues to light — some are known but unsolvable at the protocol level, some are ignored or overlooked. Nevertheless, there are invaluable lessons learned from Acala’s perspective:

- **Network congestion**: Polkadot’s sharded design with minimum 200 TPS aside, with Substrate, Acala is designing Quality of Service type transaction classification to prioritize critical transactions e.g. oracle operations, to effectively counter this issue.
- **Vulnerability in the liquidation process**: An automated on-chain liquidator/keeper (made possible by Substrate) aside, Acala is also designing a hybrid mechanism with a built-in DeX supplementing collateral auctions to ensure robustness, liquidity and optimal pricing.
- **Capital reserve**: Acala is designing a triple capital reserve system to protect the value of the network — a foreign crypto reserve (via the [decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala-white-paper/blob/master/Building_a_Decentralized_Sovereign_Wealth_Fund.pdf)) as an emergency fund, a built-in DeX that attracts liquidity as a passive reservoir, and ACA auction as last resort.
- In principle, a system or protocol should strive for decentralization to continuously lean towards **more truth and less trust**. However when trust is still required (some components are still not fully decentralized and automated), no less effort, capital, regulation, and insurance is required to counter the risks than what the centralized finance world is doing today — and that’s the price we pay for trust.

# Acala Mandala Festival 🎉

Mandala Test Network is the first in [Acala’s trilogy networks](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/announcing-the-acala-mandala-testnet-proof-of-liveness-partners-and-ecosystem-projects-3863f02df946). It’s a value-free but chaotic playground for everyone to test drive functionalities of Acala:

- borrow stablecoin aUSD with test DOT and BTC as collaterals
- built-in decentralized exchange
- functioning auction systems and oracle services

We hosted [a Mandala Festival](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/mandala-festival-prize-drops-3ae68df0dfa6) to celebrate and reward supporters and festival-goers. Now three weeks have passed, and we are near the end of it. It’s been both fascinating and rewarding to see so much participation and prize-giving:

- 260+ nodes running across 24 cities (2nd on [Polkadot Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Acala%20Mandala%20Testnet) as of 27th March)
- 350+ users with meaningful transaction qualified for lucky draws
- 20+ quality articles submitted

Check out the prize board [here](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki/W.-Contribution-&-Rewards). Coding challenge and bug bounties will go on🚀, what are you waiting for?!
