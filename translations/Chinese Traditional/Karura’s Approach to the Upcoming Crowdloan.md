Karura - это "сестринская" сеть Acala, с практически тем же кодом и является новой типом блокчейнов, который предназначен для сети Kusama в качестве её основного хаба децентрализованных финансов (DeFi). Karura будет иметь свой стейблкоин (kUSD), ликвидный стейкинг для токенов KSM, которые будут называться L-KSM, полноценный DEX, займы, кредитование и другие приложения.

Any chain, like Karura, planning to connect to [Kusama](http://kusama.network)’s ‘layer zero’ multi-chain network for interoperability and plug-and-play security is referred to as a parachain. Kusama plans to have 100+ parachain slots available in the future, but the network is still in its early stages. Hence, the network, built by Polkadot Founder, Dr. Gavin Wood, is starting with a very limited number of available parachain slots. In order to gain access to a parachain slot, any hopeful team must participate in and win a [candle auction](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction) using Kusama’s native token, KSM, which is subsequently locked for the duration of the parachain’s lease.

Karura plans to host the first Crowdloan on Kusama and participate in the first round of parachain auctions ([details on parachain auctions here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction)). Parachain auctions can be approached in many different ways, and we’ll take a minute below to explain Karura’s approach. Those who would like a deep dive on the process for obtaining a parachain slot on Kusama or its ‘cousin network’ Polkadot should read the Polkadot blog’s [detailed overview](https://polkadot.network/obtaining-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot/).

## **Karura’s Roots**

Karura is [Acala](http://acala.network)’s sister network, focused on bringing DeFi to Kusama just as Acala is bringing DeFi to Polkadot. The origins of the name Karura comes from a divine creature in Japanese, stemming from a race of birds in Hinduism. According to Japanese mythology, the karura is said to be an enormous, fire-breathing bird, which fit perfectly with the Karura network’s bold and powerful intentions. Representing the Karura brand is a Phoenix, a fiery bird that shows its resilience through continual rebirth and reinvention.

## **DeFi Features and Improvements from Karura**

The future will be determined by the open source community of builders, paving the way for new use cases and applications on Karura and Acala. Karura will begin with many ready-to-use applications, and since Karura is a ‘layer 1’ platform, many developers will also deploy Apps on top of Karura’s infrastructure. Karura will begin its life on Kusama with the apps and use cases outlined in this previous blog post below. You can also [**try it now**](https://apps.acala.network/) on Karura and Acala’s testnet, called Mandala. Also, check out the full overview of Karura’s benefits to users in a recent blog post:

# **Karura’s Approach to the Crowdloan and Parachain Auction — Introducing the Paradrop**

Karura plans to bid for the first parachain slot on Kusama and be the pioneer in the new crowdsourced network security paradigm: the **Crowdloan** and **Paradrop**. Karura will run a trustless campaign for the Kusama community, in order to lobby for support from KSM holders. The Crowdloan involves these supporters will bond their KSM on Kusama in support of Karura’s bid for a parachain lease in the Kusama parachain auction, and in turn, initiate the Paradrop.

**KAR Paradrop**: In return for KSM holders’ support, KAR (Karura’s native token) will be distributed to participants via the Paradrop. In the event Karura succeeds in its auction bid and secures a Kusama parachain lease, and network genesis of Karura occurs on Kusama, Karura will paradrop KAR to the accounts used to bond KSM in support of Karura’s parachain auction bid. The Paradrop will be in effect over the duration of the lease via a vesting schedule, and the amount of KAR that a Karura supporter will receive will depend on the level of support by the Karura supporter. This means Karura supporters can utilise the KAR received to participate in governance and staking, while the vesting schedule is realised.

**Bonding Periods:** The KSM would be bonded, or ‘locked’, in the Kusama Relay Chain for the duration of Karura’s parachain lease. This means all KSM support is locked on Kusama to support the project’s parachain auction bid. Winning this auction then allows the project to access Kusama’s plug-and-play Proof of Stake security, but all KSM are **inaccessible** to the project team.

Any KSM bonded on Kusama in support of Karura’s parachain lease auction bid will be returned in full at the end of the parachain lease (in the event the auction bid is successful), or returned at the end of the auction (if the auction bid was not unsuccessful). This means the project team will be motivated to focus on ensuring that the project and its associated network are delivering the intended utility and have real usage in terms of users and transactions.

Kusama community participants will have the option to lock their tokens on Kusama for a period of time (6, 12 or 24 months TBD). The Karura team will take the Kusama community’s preferences into account when deciding on the duration of the parachain lease to bid for. **Be on the lookout for a registration form in the coming days where we’ll begin gauging the community’s preferences on these decisions.**

**KAR Paradrop Amounts are Unpredictable:** The exact level of support that Karura will require to emerge as the winning bidder amongst other competing bidders is unknown, and the duration of the parachain lease that Karura will bid for is presently undetermined. With this said, the exact amount of KAR that will be subject to Paradrop to Karura supporters in recognition of their support for the upcoming Crowdloan will be unknown till the end of the auction. However, Karura will soon provide estimates for your reference. In a completely hypothetical example, a Karura supporter bonding X amount of KSM for Karura’s successful bid for a 6-months parachain lease would be recognized by a Paradrop of 5 KAR for her support; the same amount of KSM bonded in support of a successful bid for a 12-month parachain lease would be recognised with a Paradrop of 10 KAR given the extended duration of support.

**An _Actual_ ‘Fair’ Launch:** KAR will be Paradropped to Karura supporters in recognition of their support for Karura’s Crowdloan upon Karura network genesis on Kusama, but will be unlocked over time for transfer throughout the parachain lease period. However the full amount of the KAR Paradrop can be used for governance and other non-transfer functions to allow participation by Karura supporters in such functions from the outset of Paradrop to encourage participation and building of a strong and well-intentioned community from the ground up.

## **Next Steps and Getting Involved**

The Karura Crowdload and auction are rapidly approaching. We will soon be launching the Karura Crowdloan website, the Crowdloan registration and preferences-gathering process, and rolling out more details as they come.
