During the night, we witnessed a special piece of crypto history inside Polkadot.js and a telegram chat amongst the developers of Plasm Network and Acala. The two teams, planning to become Polkadot and Kusama parachains in the near future, have successfully connected through Polkadot’s parachain testnet and transferred Plasm’s token (PLM) cross-chain using [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain) (cross-chain message passing) functionality.

## **How We Got Here**

Acala built the xtoken ([github](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/sw/rococo-v1/xtokens)) Substrate pallet, made for cross-chain token transfers within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. We since open-sourced this pallet and made it a ‘common good’ for any parachain to integrate into their project. We also recently completed a cross-chain token transfer between the Acala testnet and Laminar testnet with cross-chain messages.

During testing, Plasm Network lead engineer, [Aleksandr Krupenkin](https://github.com/akru), found some issues with using XCM on Rococo. Aleksandr fixed the problem and his [pull request was merged by Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/309).

Finally, after the changes were accepted and XCM working properly, the two parachains completed the successful cross-chain token transfer that you can see in this video:

## **Next Steps for Acala & Karura Parachain Auctions and Launches**

Now that we have completed a cross-chain token transfer, we are one step closer to Kusama parachains starting to go live. Once the Kusama team announces the beginning of crowdloans, Acala’s Karura network (the DeFi hub of Kusama) will begin it’s process to host a KSM [crowdsourcing event](http://acala.network/karura-crowdloan) to bootstrap the network for the parachain slot auction. After the crowdsousrcing event, Karura will participate in the parachain slot auction. Upon winning this auction, Karura will then launch its mainnet. **To join the 19,000 other people on Karura Parachain Auction Waitlist and be eligible for a 10% KAR bonus split between you and your referee,** [**sign up here**](https://forms.gle/Qj8i2RxG3fHyg8DA8)**.**

How does the parachain auction process work? Watch here:

After Karura’s parachain auction, Polkadot-based crowdloans and parachain auctions will begin to happen. Acala will host another crowdsourcing event, this time for DOT, and will then use this pot of DOT to participate in the first Polkadot parachain auction. After winning an auction, Acala will then launch its mainnet.
